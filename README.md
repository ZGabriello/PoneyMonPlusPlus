# Poneymon

An awesome game featuring poneys challenging themselves in an intense fight to win a race !


## How to play

In the current version, there is no menu to choose poneys,
so we chose to instantiate 5 poneys. The first and fifth ones
can be played by humans and the power can be used with the keys
NUMPAD1 and NUMPAD5 respectively. The power can only be used once.

### Poneys controlled by IA

* The 2nd poney implements the "MoreSpeedNyanStrategy" which uses the power when he has a high speed (> 0.5), 1 being the highest speed
* The 3rd poney implements the "NotEnoughSpeedNyanStrategy" which uses the power when he has a low speed (< 0.4)
* The 4th poney implements the "ImStillHereNyanStrategy" which uses the power when he can reduce the distance between him and the leading poney by 0.5, with 1 being a full turn

It will produce a .jar that you can run giving the main class :

```
java -cp target/poneymon_fx-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar fr.univ_lyon1.info.m1.poneymon_fx.App
```

## Coding style tests

Based on
Checkstyle configuration that checks the Google coding conventions from Google Java Style
that can be found at https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html.
 
Checkstyle is very configurable. Documentation can be read at
